## 🎯 About The Game

**Blackjack**, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino games worldwide. It's a card game where players attempt to reach a hand value as close to 21 as possible - without exceeding it. Going over is called a "bust," and you lose. The goal is to beat the dealer's hand, either by having a total closer to 21 or if the dealer busts.

### 👥 Players:
- **You**: The Risktaker!
- **Computer**: The Dealer!

### 🃏 Card Values:
- **Number Cards**: Face Value (2-10)
- **Face Cards**: 10 Points (King, Queen, Jack)
- **Ace**: 1 or 11 Points - Whichever is more favorable!

### 🎉 Winning:
- Get a Blackjack (Ace + 10-point card) and hope the dealer doesn’t too, or
- Finish with a higher score than the dealer (without busting), or
- Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Start the game and place your bet!
- You'll get two cards and so will the dealer.
- Aim to hit 21, or at least beat the dealer’s hand.
- Type 'y' to hit and get another card or 'n' to stand.
- If you’re dealt an Ace and 10-point card as your first two cards, that's Blackjack!
- If you don’t bust, it will then be the dealer's turn, revealing their hidden card and taking additional cards if needed.
- If the dealer doesn’t bust, the player with the hand closest to 21 wins!
  
## 📖 Rules
- The dealer must draw cards until they have at least 17 and must stand at 17 or higher.
- Aces can be 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.
- Players win if:
  - Their total is higher than the dealer.
  - They have blackjack, and the dealer doesn’t.
  - The dealer busts.
